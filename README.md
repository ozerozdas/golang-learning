# Go Lang Learning Examples

This repo has been prepared as a personal study for golang examples. You can use it to practice and study.
I created some examples myself and compiled some from different sources.

Go to the example you want and run the code below
```
    go build main.go && ./main
```
or
```
    go run main.go
```
